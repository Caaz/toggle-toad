# Toggle Toad

A settings/feature flag/whatever tool for managing deployments externally, without needing to fiddle with redeploying.

## Development

I'm still figuring this out, but here's what I'm doing!

### Prerequisites
In theory, you'll need docker compose set up. I imagine Podman would work as well.

### Running a local development server

- `docker compose up` 
    - This'll start all the services, and assuming I did things right, changes locally will update the container.

### Running in production

Buddy I'm not even there yet
